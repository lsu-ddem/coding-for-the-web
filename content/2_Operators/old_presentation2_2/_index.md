# Assignment Operators 

* JavaScript's assignment operators are used to assign variables to different values. Assignment operators each have a symbol known as the operator that is used to perform the operation.

## 1. Equals : used to assign a variable to a value
* Operator: =

* Examples:
```
let example = 5;
let name = "Alex";
name = example;
```
* Q : What is the value of the variable named "name"?
---
## 2. Plus-Equals : assigning a variable to its original value plus some specified value
* Operator: += 
* Examples:
```
x = 5;
y = 30;
x += 10;
x += y;
y += x;
```
* Q : What is the value of variable y?
---
## 3. Minus-Equals : assigning a variable to its original value minus some specified value
* Operator: -= 
* Examples:
```
x = 50;
y = 23;
x -= 12;
x -= y;
y -= x;
```
* Q : What is the value of variable y?
---
## 4. Times-Equals : assigning a variable to its original value times some specified value
* Operator: *= 
* Examples:
```
x = 13;
y = 9;
x *= 3;
x *= y;
y *= x;
```
* Q : What is the value of variable y?
---
## 5. Divide-Equals : assigning a variable to its original value divided by some specified value
* Operator: /= 
* Examples:
```
x = 348;
y = 24;
x /= 58;
y /= x;
```
* Q : What is the value of variable y?
---
## 6. Modulus-Equals : assigning a variable to its original value modulus some specified value
* Operator: %= 
* Examples:
```
x = 49;
y = 17;
x %= 12;
y %= x;
```
* Q : What is the value of variable y?
